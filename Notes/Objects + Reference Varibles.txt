Objects + Reference Varibles
Primitive Varible: num/value is stored
int x = 0
int y = x;
y += 1;
System.out.println(x); // 0

Objects + Reference Varibles - Stores the address to where the object is in memory

(x,y) point
Point = p1 = new Point(0,0);
Point p2 = new Point(1,1);
Point p3 = p1; -> p3 points to the same address as p1
p2.setX(5); -> changes the point of p2 to (5,1)
p3.setX(10); -> changes the point of p1 because they are pointing to the same address

== vs .equals()
x == y -> compares the stored value of x and y
p1 == p2 -> returns false because they are pointing to different addresses
p1.equals(p2) -> returns true if the points are the same

String choice = "_____";
if choice == "yes") -> returns false because they are not the same object
if choice.equals("yes")) -> returns true
