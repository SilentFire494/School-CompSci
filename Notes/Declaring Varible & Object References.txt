Declaring Variables Type
type varName; -> creates memory location for the variable
int x = 1; int x += 1; -> This fails because java thinks you are trying to make another variable called x instead do x += 1; or x = x + 1;

Scope of a varible - Where and when the varible exists
{} - curly braces define the scope of a variable, it only exists inside those brackets

int num = ___;
if (num % 2 == 0)
{
    boolean even = true;

}
else
{
    boolean even = false;
}
System.out.println(even); -> This will not work because even is only defined inside the if statement currect way to do it is
int num = ___;
boolean even;
if (num % 2 == 0)
{
    even = true;

}
else
{
    even = false;
}
