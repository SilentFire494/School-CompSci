Data Types

Primitive
Building blocks of language (Simplest)
always lowercase
Java Primitive: boolean, char(single character), int, double(float). Sorted from smallest to largest in memory

Objects
Containss multiple values and methods
Uppercase
Ex: String

Operations - resulting value will be the bigger type by default
Ex: 4+3.0 -> 3.0 as an double

Java has auto conversions:
Ex:
char c = 'A' // 65 in ascii
int x = c+1
'A' +1 = 66

Declaring Types
int points = 9;
int total = 10;
double grade = points/total; // if you want decimal result you have to declare double if you dont the answer would be an interger 0.9 as an int is 0

Variables
Must be expressed as 'type var' because java makes memory size based off type
Variable must be small enough to fit in said memory size
double x = 2;
int y = x;

Casting- Anytime going from bigger type to smaller
(type) value
(int) userchoice
double x = 2;
int y = (double) x;
Cannot cast between Primitive and Objects unless its a String

int point = 5;
String message = "your total is  " + points;
